# QR_Logo
# A code that allows the user to create/generate a QR code. Maily focused on the qrcode library which allows us to create/generate a QR code with particular formatting options (e.g. insertion of a logo) with the help of the PIL library that will display the data (in this case a YouTube video link) when the QR code is scannned with a compatible scanner/camera.
